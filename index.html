      <h2><i class="material-icons">star</i> Background</h2><br />
      <p><strong>Professional Vision</strong></p>
      <p>Straight out of graduate school, I began leading highly successful retreats for writers seeking a productive creative immersion (with a 30% recurring customer ratio. I believe in cultivating long term partnerships.</p>

        <p>I founded Writing Immersion Retreats to bring immersive learning and creative collaboration to writers of all skill levels and backgrounds from all over the globe.</p>
        
        <p>I handled travel logistics, curriculum development, sponsorship of materials, day trips, daily instruction in one-on-one and group sessions. social media campaigns, web site design and content creation. Course facilitation involved the production of over 300 pages of original curriculum.</p>
        
        <p>The guiding vision: sustainable agriculture, ecopoetics, the creative process as somatic phenomenon, meditation, tantra hatha yoga, direct observation writing, achieving personal mastery. These lasted from one to three weeks in duration.</p>
        
        <p>I have experience mentoring new writers as well as authors of award-winning books of poetry, fantasy and sci-fi novels, children's literature, YA fiction, historical fiction, travelogue, memoir.</p><br />
        
        <p><strong>Hands-On Building Expertise</strong></p>
        
        <p>Inspired by my experience leading retreats, I sought to do my own deep work to further overcome creative blocks and achieve personal/professional mastery.</p>

        <p>I worked to build my own small retreat center and working farm -- off grid, using only hand tools.</p>

        <p>Materials ranged from wood, earth, timber, and ferrocement construction, mostly bermed Earthship-style, and some constructed on wheels (Sprinter van conversion and tiny house on flat trailer construction).</p>

        <p>Exceptionally resourceful, I excel when challenged.</p>
