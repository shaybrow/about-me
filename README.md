## About Me with a guessing game

Based on the assignment guidelines, I built a website with a brief bio. The visitor is greeted first with a series of yes/no answer prompts.

### Reflections and Comments

 -I found that I spent a great deal of time mulling over the potential audience/purpose for the bio elements.

 -The JS components were enjoyable and felt straightforward. I had a few different ideas for other ways of engaging this element of the assignment.

 -I would have liked to have had more time to spend styling CSS. Lots of potential for improvement there!

 -Great practice for keeping things simple when they involve many moving parts.
